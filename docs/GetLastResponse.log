in this file we have a function that waits for and retrieves the last response from the DeepSeek chat interface



line 1-2:
    importing librarys
    librarys:
        time: for hesitating and waiting for certain events to happen

line 4-5:
    waits for any message to appear on the page
    uses the selector ".ds-message" with a timeout of 10 seconds
    this ensures that at least one message exists before proceeding
    -->manuall add: meaning that it waits a bit just in case to make sure the message div at least have been appeared

line 7-10:
    initializes variables for monitoring response completion
    vars:
        last_text: stores the previous text content to compare changes
        stable_count: counts how many times the text has remained unchanged
        started: boolean flag to track if response generation has begun
        --> manuall add: meaning that it makes sure it has started the typing animation -->then it makes sure its a diffrent text from the before one --> then it tries to find out if the typing animation is finished -->
        --> manuall add: in here we ONLY put the variables to keep track

line 12-36:
    enters an infinite loop to monitor response completion
    monitoring process:
        gets all message elements using xpath selector for divs with 'ds-message' class
        --> manuall add: uses xpath to find every single div that have the class of ds-message
        extracts text content from the last message
        --> manuall add: extracts the first text content in this div
        checks if response has started (at least 5 characters)
        --> using varables that we initialized up there, we try to find if its started or not, ALSO if it did, is it big enough to be counted as a usable response?
        only starts monitoring after response has begun
        compares current text with previous text
        if text is stable for 5 consecutive checks, assumes response is complete
        if text changes, resets the stable counter
        handles exceptions gracefully by continuing the loop

line 36:
    sleeps for 0.2 seconds between checks for faster response detection
    this provides a good balance between responsiveness and system load



this doc is written personally by me once, and then it will be maintained by ai till the really end of this project, then ill change it again, 
maintaining a really good doc is hard, specially WHILE codig the project, ai will do the hard part of my docs, 
after im sure that this project is ready for a launch, then ill doc it manually AGAIN
