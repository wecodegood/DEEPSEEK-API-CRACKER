in this file we have a function that sends an initial system message to configure the AI's behavior for the CLI interface



line 1-8:
    defines the InitMessage function
    parameters:
        browser: browser instance for web automation
        page: page object representing the current webpage

line 3-4:
    creates a system prompt string that configures the AI's behavior
    the prompt instructs the AI to:
        act as deepseek_cli, a CLI version of the DeepSeek LLM
        understand it's being run through a headless web automator
        use the special character "..S.." at the beginning of every response
        add a newline after the special character for clean formatting
        not mention the web automation aspect to users
        respond as if being asked through an API
        treat this initialization as a simple "Hello" greeting

line 6:
    fills the message input field with the system prompt
    uses page.get_by_placeholder() to find the "Message DeepSeek" input field
    fills it with the configured prompt text

line 8:
    sends the message by pressing Enter
    uses page.keyboard.press() to simulate Enter key press
    this submits the system message to configure the AI's behavior
