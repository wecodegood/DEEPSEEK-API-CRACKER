commit_1 --> big commit 1:
    i forgot to commit from the beginning of the project
    in the first commit we have initialised our connection
    project:
        main.py --> the file that we run to use the app
        initMods --> initialise moduals:
            Loginer.py --> logs into deepseek automatically
            Message.py --> sents a initialise message for deepseek, that contains a prompt to optimise it for the app
            /
    run_timeline:
        1.firefox opens
        2.Loginer.py logs into deepseek with email and password
        3.Message.py sents a message with the initialise prompt
        4.we get inside a loop:
            1.loop happens forever
            2.in this loop we sent a message to deepseek
            /
        /
    next_step:
